This function was copied from the [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/resources/recipes.html#logging-entry-and-exit-of-functions-with-a-decorator) documentation and it logs information that enters and exits a function.  
It's imported with the expression: 'from logfunction import logger_wraps' and it
is used as a decorator on the function we want to monitor: '@logger_wraps'.
